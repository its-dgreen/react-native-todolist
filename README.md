## Post-Mortem

This was my first attempt to create anything with React Native. Definitely
planning on working more with it and seeing how it compares to Xamarin, which
I've used a lot of in the past. App dev is definitely a different beast than web
dev, even in a small todo-list, I'm definitely excited to do more with it.
